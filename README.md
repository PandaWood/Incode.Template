NetCode.Template produces text output from executable .NET code templates intermixed with text, similar to old-style ASP code.

This is a continuation of Lasse V. Karlsen's texttemplate project on CodePlex (lasse@vkarlsen.no)
Original URL http://texttemplate.codeplex.com/

I've got it compiling and passing all tests (on mono too)...
So it's probably good to go from here.
